# Breaking_breaks_using_Computer_vision
This Project is related to converting a retro game into a new game with more physical interaction(must required by my mom in each pc game) not just eye and finger coordination using deep learning. Game interface is not that great but real fun to play with family and friends(if you can bet on your physical strength).

# Step to create the game
1. You can use the game from the same code given in the code folder.
2. Train the model using the posture you want to implement to make paddle move left and right(see code for more detail). I used

3. Used openCV and keras to predict the posture
4. Run them and enjoy!

# Extra Information
You can train any model seeing his accuracy and latency time. I used DenseNet model which give better accuracy but compromise with latency.

# If you want to play
If you want to play
1. Download the model.
2. Download game script.
3. Download dl_model script
4. Change the path of the model in the script and install the library if needed.
5. You can play it.
