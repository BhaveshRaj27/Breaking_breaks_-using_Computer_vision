# Breaking_breaks_-using_Computer_vision
This Project is related to converting a retro game into a new game with more physical interaction(must required by my mom in each pc game) not just eye and finger coordination using deep learning. Game interface is not that great but real fun to play with family(if you can bet on your physical strength).
